# Emotion-Classification-Model\
A simple text-based emotion classifier built with Python, scikit-learn, and optional UI interfaces using Gradio or Streamlit. The model classifies input text into emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, or Neutral.

Features
 1. Loads and preprocesses a dataset of labeled texts
 2. Trains a Logistic Regression classifier using TF-IDF features
 3. Evaluates model performance with accuracy and confusion matrix
 4. Provides an easy-to-use interface for real-time emotion prediction via Gradio or Streamlit

## Dataset
This project uses a small sample dataset embedded in the code for demonstration purposes. For better results, replace it with a larger dataset 

## Results
- Displays an accuracy score on the test set
- Shows a confusion matrix to visualize model performance


## Future Improvements
- Use larger datasets for better accuracy
- Implement more advanced models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, Deep Learning)
- Add multi-language support
- Create a web app with a more polished UI
